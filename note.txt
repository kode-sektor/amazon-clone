Consider this as a notepad chronicling the processes and personal challenges in buiilding this application.

The first obstacle I encountered was one I never even envisaged from the get-go: font. Apparently, Amazon makes use of 
a proprietary font named "Amazon Ember". 


FONT ISSUES

The first hurdle I encountered was surprise, suprise : font family. Amazon uses a propietary font named "Amazon Ember". 
At first, I made use of a font called "Segoe UI" which worked wonders in my opinion. It appeared similar to the Amazon
propietary font but anyways, I was not still contented with it. After a bit of research, I later laid my hands on the Amazon
font, downloaded it and included it using the CSS3 @font-face. Hurdle 1 side-stepped.


STYLING OPTION TAG

Having to nest any other element inside option tag is not feasible. Trying to give a background-image rule on 
option also fails. Knowing this, formatting the country list in the Country / Region modal is quite an hurdle.
It was left that way but the best is to use some other format options to perfectly obtain the same design, with something
like maybe a list.
