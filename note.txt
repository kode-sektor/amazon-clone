Consider this as a notepad chronicling the processes and personal challenges in buiilding this application.

The first obstacle I encountered was one I never even envisaged from the get-go: font. Apparently, Amazon makes use of 
a proprietary font named "Amazon Ember". 


FONT ISSUES

The first hurdle I encountered was surprise, suprise : font family. Amazon uses a propietary font named "Amazon Ember". 
At first, I made use of a font called "Segoe UI" which worked wonders in my opinion. It appeared similar to the Amazon
propietary font but anyways, I was not still contented with it. After a bit of research, I later laid my hands on the Amazon
font, downloaded it and included it using the CSS3 @font-face. Hurdle 1 side-stepped.
