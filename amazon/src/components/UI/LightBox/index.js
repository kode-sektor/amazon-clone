                        My original credit card company was changing my card with new terms and condition. So I thought maybe this Amazon reward master card would be a good replacement. It turned out to be a huge and massive disaster. First of all, it took a long time to arrive after the approval. 2nd, after it arrive it was very difficult to activate. When I finally activated, it's not usable in any store except on Amazon.ca; so it is not a master card but more like a membership card for Amazon only. I thought OK, maybe it's their new product, so they need some time to set up. My nightmare hasn't fully mature until the payment date. I wasn't able to make payment to my account despite many attempts in their website, at my bank, with my iPhone bank app. On their statement, the account number are blocked. Even my bank can't figure out how to pay. My calls got into some kind of loop. I can't talk to human.  This credit card is just frustration times 1000!!!!! I wasted so much of my time dealing with this crab. Now, I am not able to make payment into my account. Instead of rewards, I'm going to get charge. If you are a support from MBNA, please contact me and help me. I need to make payment today!! PLEASE!!!!!

                        Good card for Prime members. Pair it with Rakuten and you can get some pretty good deals.<br/><br/>
                        Lots of commentary on FX but people are failing to mention that you get 2.5% back on all FX which neutralizes any fees. Not perfect but better than  most cards in Canada.

                        I should have applied for the Amazon Rewards MasterCard years ago. It just makes perfect sense. Iâ€™ve been shopping at Amazon for so many years and I would say itâ€™s where I shop more then any other store.  Now I can collect points and get rewards where Iâ€™ll be able to use them. It was super easy to apply and super quick approval. It took about a week to get my card.
