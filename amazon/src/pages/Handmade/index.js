Amazon uses an application process to add new Artisans to the Handmade category to ensure customers are able to buy with confidence. Learn more about our <Link to="/">Handmade guidelines here.</Link>

While the Professional Selling plan costs CAD $29.99 per month for an Amazon Seller, this monthly fee is waived for Handmade Artisans. <Link to="/">Learn more about our fees here.</Link>

You will register with a Professional Selling plan (if you donâ€™t have one already), set up your shop location, choose your business name, set up your payment method and provide a credit card number (so that we can verify your identity). Once youâ€™ve completed your registration, resources are available to create your first listing, set up your Artisan profile, and manage your business.

If you donâ€™t see your category listed, this means we do not allow the sale of those items in the Handmade store. Popular categories not currently available include Digital or Downloadable Products, Food & Grocery items, and Electronics. You may consider registering to sell and listing your products in another Amazon store, or check back in the future to see if the category becomes available on Handmade.

Log in to Seller Central and choose your desired country from the drop down menu on the upper right corner of your screen. In addition, you can register to sell on our five European stores (Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, Amazon.it, Amazon.es).
